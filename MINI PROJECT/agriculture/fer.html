<h2 align=center>â€œ<big><u>Organic Fertilizers</u></big> are fertilizers that are naturally produced. "</h2><br>
<h3 align=left>Fertilizers are materials that can be added to soil or plants, in order to provide nutrients and sustain growth.Typical organic fertilizers include all animal waste including meat processing waste, manure, slurry, and guano; plus plant based fertilizers such as compost; and biosolids.[2] Inorganic "organic fertilizers" include minerals and ash. The organic-mess refers to the Principles of Organic Agriculture, which determines whether a fertilizer can be used for commercial organic agriculture, not whether the fertilizer consists of organic compounds.</h3>
<h3>Organic fertilizer is an essential source of plant nutrients and soil. Organic fertilizers differ from chemical fertilizers in that they provide nutrients for your plants while creating healthy soil. They are considered a greener option.Soils with large amounts of the organic matter remain loose and light, retain more water and nutrients and promote the growth of soil microorganisms, thereby improving plant health and root development.</h3>
<h2><u>Significance of Organic fertilizer</u></h2>
<h3>With the continuous development of modern agriculture, the role of organic fertilizers in agricultural production is becoming more and more important. Agricultural products grown with organic fertilizers have good taste and can effectively maintain the unique nutrition and flavor of fruits and vegetables, and also play a pivotal role in the protection and improvement of the soil environment. Therefore, it is necessary for us to apply and understand organic fertilizers.</h3>
<h2><u>Pros & Cons</u></h2>
<h3><u><big>Pros:</big></u></h3>
<h3> Boost both nutrient efficiency and organic matter content in the soil
It improves water movement into the soil and, in time, add structure to the soil. Organics feed beneficial microbes, making the soil more comfortable to work.</h3>
<h3><u><big>Cons:</big></u></h3>
<h3>Before nutrients can be released into the soil, microorganisms need to break down the organic components. As organisms need suitable temperature and sufficient water to do their jobs, the effectiveness of organic fertilizers is limited by these factors.</h3>
